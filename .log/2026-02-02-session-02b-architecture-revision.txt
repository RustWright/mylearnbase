● Based on project.md, you're at Session 2b: Architecture Revision. The Dioxus
  SSG PoC failed — it outputs empty HTML despite correct setup. Meanwhile, Zola
  validated successfully (195ms build, full pre-rendered content).

  The options identified were:
  1. Zola (pure SSG) — Mature, fast, native Cloudflare support
  2. Leptos SSG — Experimental, not fully tested
  3. Hybrid (Zola + Rust WASM) — Static blog via Zola, interactive demos via
  WASM islands later

  Ready to start the architecture revision? My first question:

  Given that your MVP scope is blog/articles with portfolio and interactive 
  demos deferred, does the pure Zola path make sense for now — knowing you can 
  add WASM-based interactivity later when you actually need it?

❯ that's honestly how I was leaning, I believe for the first version of     
  this so we can keep our momentum, going with pure Zola is the right       
  option, I just want us to discuss and clarify what it looks like to add   
  the WASM-based interactivity later because I don't really understand how  
  that would work, I want to make sure we're setting ourselves up for an    
  easy transition later on, rather than having to essentially rewrite the   
  entire website later                                                      

● Great instinct to clarify this before committing. Let me explain how the
  hybrid path works — it's less scary than it sounds.

  The core concept: Islands Architecture

  Your Zola site stays exactly as-is. WASM "islands" are self-contained
  interactive widgets you embed into specific pages. Think of it like embedding
  a YouTube video — the page is still HTML, you're just dropping in something
  interactive.

  Concrete example:

  Say you write a blog post about a sorting algorithm and want an interactive
  visualization.

  <!-- content/blog/sorting-visualized.md -->
  +++
  title = "Sorting Algorithms Visualized"
  +++

  Here's how bubble sort works...

  <div id="sorting-demo"></div>
  <script type="module">
    import init from '/wasm/sorting-demo.js';
    init();
  </script>

  As you can see from playing with it...

  The WASM app (built separately with Dioxus, Leptos, or Yew) hydrates just that
   <div>. Everything else remains static HTML.

  What changes when you add interactivity:
  Aspect: Blog content
  Pure Zola (now): Markdown files
  With WASM islands (later): Same, unchanged
  ────────────────────────────────────────
  Aspect: Templates
  Pure Zola (now): Zola Tera templates
  With WASM islands (later): Same, unchanged
  ────────────────────────────────────────
  Aspect: Build
  Pure Zola (now): zola build
  With WASM islands (later): zola build + wasm-pack build for demos
  ────────────────────────────────────────
  Aspect: Hosting
  Pure Zola (now): Cloudflare Pages
  With WASM islands (later): Same, just also serves .wasm files
  ────────────────────────────────────────
  Aspect: URL structure
  Pure Zola (now): Your choice
  With WASM islands (later): Same, unchanged
  Key point: It's additive, not a rewrite.

  Your Zola site doesn't transform into a WASM app. You're just adding optional
  interactive widgets to specific pages when needed.

  One question to confirm the path:

  Are your envisioned interactive demos mostly self-contained (a visualization,
  a game, a calculator) — or would you need deep integration where the WASM
  controls navigation, shared state across pages, etc.?

❯ I'm currently envisioning self contained demos, not something that needs  
  shared state across the entire website                                    

● That's the ideal scenario for islands. Each demo is its own mini-app — loads
  only on pages that use it, no complex coordination needed.

  What your project structure might look like later:

  mylearningbase/
  ├── content/           # Zola markdown (unchanged)
  ├── templates/         # Zola templates (unchanged)
  ├── static/
  │   └── wasm/          # Compiled demo bundles
  ├── demos/             # Rust workspace for interactive demos
  │   ├── sorting-viz/
  │   └── pathfinding/
  └── config.toml        # Zola config (unchanged)

  Each demo in demos/ compiles to its own .wasm + .js file. You embed whichever
  ones you need. Pages without demos have zero WASM overhead.

  Summary of the revised architecture:

  - Now: Pure Zola. Blog, series, basic portfolio — all static.
  - Later: Add a demos/ workspace when you need interactivity. Embed islands
  into specific posts. Zola remains the backbone.
  - Never needed: Full site rewrite, migration away from Zola, or complex state
  management.

  Any remaining concerns before I update architecture.md with the revised tech
  decision and rationale?

❯ you've talked about serving the .wasm bundles, I guess that means we'll   
  need a server backend to host these files? or how will the client get the 
   bundles, or would the bundles be static files served by cloudflare too?  

● No server needed — WASM bundles are static files, just like images or CSS.

  When you compile a Rust WASM project, you get:
  - demo.wasm — the compiled binary
  - demo.js — glue code that loads it

  These go in your static/wasm/ folder. Zola copies them to the build output.
  Cloudflare Pages serves them like any other file.

  The flow:

  User visits /blog/sorting-visualized/
      ↓
  Cloudflare serves the static HTML (from Zola)
      ↓
  Browser sees <script src="/wasm/sorting-demo.js">
      ↓
  Browser fetches sorting-demo.js and sorting-demo.wasm (static files from
  Cloudflare)
      ↓
  WASM runs in browser

  No backend, no server functions, no Fly.io needed — still pure static hosting
  at zero cost. The "server" is just Cloudflare's CDN serving files.

  The only time you'd need a real backend is if a demo needed to save data, call
   external APIs server-side, or do something that can't run in the browser.
  That's a separate concern from the WASM interactivity itself.

  Does that clear it up?

❯ yeah it does, so what decisions need to be made before we can confidently 
   conclude this architecture review and move on to planning again          

● Let me check what's settled vs what might need a decision:

  Settled:
  - Framework: Zola (replacing Dioxus)
  - Hosting: Cloudflare Pages (unchanged)
  - Content format: Markdown + frontmatter (unchanged)
  - Future interactivity: WASM islands, additive approach
  - PoC: Already validated (poc-zola/ works)

  Needs confirmation or brief discussion:

  1. Backend (Fly.io) — Originally planned for "future" Dioxus server functions.
   Still needed? Or defer entirely since WASM demos run client-side?
  2. Testing strategy — Original plan was "Rust compiler + manual + content
  validation script." Zola has built-in link checking and is battle-tested.
  Simplify to just zola check + manual?
  3. Risk register — Dioxus SSG risk materialized. Need to update with any new
  Zola-specific risks (though it's mature, so likely minimal).

  That's it. The MVP scope (homepage, blog list, posts, series, RSS, deploy)
  stays the same — Zola handles all of it.

  Want to discuss any of those three, or are you comfortable with:
  - Backend: Defer (not needed for MVP or client-side demos)
  - Testing: Simplify to zola check + manual
  - Risks: Update docs to reflect the pivot

❯ so yes defer the backend, if we ever get to a point with the website      
  where a real backend is needed we can figure things out then, in terms of 
   testing, I'm fine with the simplicity of the zola check + manual         
  verification, but I plan to work with a lot of large language models      
  especially with any UI design and setup because I really don't enjoy UI   
  design, is there a way of testing that will make UI feedback with these   
  models easier, lastly lets think carefully through any risks that might   
  come up from this pivot and document them clearly and research any        
  mitigation if needed                                                      

● Good questions. Let me address each:

  UI Feedback with LLMs

  The simplest approach that fits your workflow: screenshots + conversation.

  - zola serve gives you hot reload at localhost:1111
  - Take screenshots when you want feedback
  - Share with the LLM: "Here's how the blog list looks, what's off?"

  If you want something more structured later, you could add a script that uses
  Playwright to capture screenshots of key pages automatically. But for MVP,
  manual screenshots are zero-overhead and work well.

  Risks from the Zola Pivot

  Let me think through these carefully:
  Risk: Zola learning curve (Tera templates, config)
  Likelihood: Medium
  Impact: Low
  Mitigation: Docs are excellent, simpler than Dioxus was going to be
  ────────────────────────────────────────
  Risk: Design paralysis (you mentioned disliking UI work)
  Likelihood: High
  Impact: Medium
  Mitigation: Start from existing theme or minimal base, iterate with LLM
    feedback
  ────────────────────────────────────────
  Risk: WASM integration complexity later
  Likelihood: Low
  Impact: Medium
  Mitigation: Defer learning until needed; well-documented when you get there
  ────────────────────────────────────────
  Risk: Zola can't do something you need
  Likelihood: Low
  Impact: Medium
  Mitigation: Very flexible for static sites; escape hatch is WASM islands or
  raw
     HTML
  ────────────────────────────────────────
  Risk: Template lock-in
  Likelihood: Low
  Impact: Low
  Mitigation: Content stays portable (markdown); templates are minimal code for
    personal site
  ────────────────────────────────────────
  Risk: Syntax highlighting gaps
  Likelihood: Low
  Impact: Low
  Mitigation: Zola uses syntect with broad language support; custom syntaxes can

    be added
  The "design paralysis" one stands out given what you said. Want me to research
   Zola themes or minimal starting points that could reduce that friction? Or do
   you have a visual direction in mind already?

❯ that's the problem, I don't think an architecture session is the place to 
   research Zola themes, but make a note for us to tackle any major UI      
  design decisions in the planning session, this would involve selecting    
  the starting theme for the MVP                                            

● You're right — theme selection is a planning concern, not architecture. Noted.

  Architecture revision summary:
  Decision: Framework
  Original: Dioxus 0.7
  Revised: Zola
  Rationale: Dioxus SSG broken; Zola validated, mature
  ────────────────────────────────────────
  Decision: Backend
  Original: Fly.io (future)
  Revised: Deferred entirely
  Rationale: Not needed for static site or client-side WASM demos
  ────────────────────────────────────────
  Decision: Future interactivity
  Original: N/A
  Revised: WASM islands (additive)
  Rationale: Self-contained demos embed into static pages
  ────────────────────────────────────────
  Decision: Testing
  Original: Rust compiler + manual + validation script
  Revised: zola check + manual + screenshots for LLM feedback
  Rationale: Simpler toolchain, Zola has built-in checks
  Risks updated:
  - Dioxus SSG risk: Materialized, pivoted away
  - New key risk: Design paralysis — mitigate via theme selection in planning

  Note for Session 3: Include theme selection as early task to unblock UI work.

      61  **Why this approach:**
      62  - `slug` decouples URL from filename and title — rename files o
          r update titles without breaking links
      68 -- Files can be renamed/reorganized without breaking relationshi
         -ps                                                             
      69 -- Series defined by metadata, not folders                      
      70 -- Maximum flexibility for future changes                       
      63 +- Series via taxonomies gives automatic series pages           
      64 +- Standard Zola patterns = better docs and community support

      116  | Type | Approach |
      117  |------|----------|
      122 -| **Type safety** | Rust compiler + `dx build` |              
      118 +| **Build validation** | `zola check` (links, references, conf
          +ig) |                                                         
      119  | **Manual** | Click-through before deploys |
      124 -| **Content validation** | Script to validate frontmatter (fie
          -lds exist, dates valid) |

      125  ## Deployment
      126  
      131 -**Static site (MVP):**                                        
      132 -- Build: `dx build --release --ssg`                           
      133 -- Host: Cloudflare Pages                                      
      134 -- Custom build command handles Rust/Dioxus CLI installation   
      127 +**Build command:** `zola build`                               
      128 +**Output directory:** `public/`                               
      129 +**Host:** Cloudflare Pages (native Zola support, zero config) 
      130  
      136 -**Backend (future):**                                         
      137 -- Fly.io with Docker                                          
      138 -- Only when interactive demos require server-side functionalit
          -y                                                             
      131 +Cloudflare Pages auto-detects Zola projects. No custom build c
          +ommands needed.

      135 +## Future: WASM Interactivity                                 
      136 +                                                              
      137 +When interactive demos are needed (Cycle 2+), the approach is 
          +**additive, not a rewrite**.                                  
      138 +                                                              
      139 +**How it works:**                                             
      140 +1. Create a separate Rust crate for demos (e.g., `demos/sortin
          +g-viz/`)                                                      
      141 +2. Compile to WASM using `wasm-pack` or `trunk`               
      142 +3. Output `.wasm` + `.js` files to `static/wasm/`             
      143 +4. Embed in specific posts via `<div>` + `<script>` tags      
      144 +5. Zola serves these as static files — no backend needed      
      145 +                                                              
      146 +**Example embed in markdown:**                                
      147 +```markdown

● Done. Both architecture.md and project.md are updated.

  Session 2b complete. The architecture is now:
  - Zola for static site generation
  - Cloudflare Pages for hosting (unchanged)
  - WASM islands as the future interactivity path (additive, no rewrite)
  - Backend deferred entirely

  Ready to start Session 3: Planning when you are. First task will be theme
  selection to address the design paralysis risk.

❯ what are the steps needed to fully close out this session 

● To close out Session 2b:

  1. Export the conversation
    - Run /export
    - Save as: .log/2026-02-02-session-02b-architecture-revision.txt
  2. Commit changes
  git add architecture.md project.md
  git commit -m "Session 2b: Architecture revision - pivot to Zola"
  3. (Already done) — project.md and architecture.md are updated with session
  summary

  That's it. Let me know when you've exported and I can help with the commit if
  needed.

❯ I'll handle the export and the commit, thanks, I'll see you in the next   
  session                                                                   

● Sounds good. See you in Session 3 — we'll tackle theme selection first, then
  break down the MVP tasks.
