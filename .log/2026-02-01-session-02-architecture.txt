● Got it. Let's begin Session 2: Architecture.

  I'll guide you through the key architectural decisions. My role is to present
  options with trade-offs, answer your questions, and document your decisions.

  ---
  Starting Point

  Before diving into specific technologies, a few questions to understand your
  context:

  1. Technical background — What's your experience level with:
  - Frontend frameworks (React, Vue, Svelte, etc.)?
  - Static site generators (Hugo, Astro, Next.js, etc.)?
  - Backend/deployment (Node, serverless, Docker)?

  2. Existing preferences — Do you already have:
  - A hosting provider you prefer or use (Vercel, Netlify, VPS, etc.)?
  - A domain name purchased?
  - Strong opinions on any specific technology?

  3. Content authoring — How do you prefer to write?
  - Markdown in a code editor?
  - Visual/WYSIWYG editor?
  - Something else?

  This will help me tailor the options to your situation rather than giving
  generic recommendations.

❯ make an edit to both the project process and the CLAUDE.md to make sure   
  that whenever a lot questions need to be asked, they are asked one at a   
  time so I can give a clear and detailed answer for each one, then try     
  again

  Session 2: Architecture

  First question:

  What's your experience level with frontend frameworks? (React, Vue, Svelte, or
   none/vanilla JS)

❯ I have some limited experience working with React and vanilla JS, no      
  experience with Vue or Svelte, I'm currently aiming to get more           
  proficient using Dioxus though, and it would be my preferred tool unless  
  there are strong reasons not to use it, you can review it's documentation 
   as needed in @resources/dioxus/                                          
  ⎿  Listed directory resources/dioxus/

● Got it. Let me review the Dioxus documentation you've provided.

● Searched for 1 pattern, read 1 file (ctrl+o to expand)

● Good context. Dioxus 0.7 is a capable choice - it supports:
  - Web via WASM with SSR and SSG
  - Fullstack with Axum backend and server functions
  - Static site generation via dx bundle --web --ssg

  This aligns well with your goals (blog + portfolio + interactive demos). Using
   it here gives you real practice while building something useful.

  There are trade-offs we'll discuss when we get to the technology decision, but
   your preference is noted.

  ---
  Next question:

  How do you prefer to write content for your blog posts - markdown in a code
  editor, or would you want some kind of visual/WYSIWYG editor?

❯ If it's text heavy content, including code snippets and the like then a   
  markdown code editor would be my preferred option, and I think that may   
  be the type of project I work on more often, if I'm working on anything   
  involving images or videos or any other sort of visual content outside    
  text then a way to verify that things get laid out and show up properly   
  would be needed                                                           

● That makes sense. So:
  - Primary: Markdown files in editor (text + code snippets)
  - When needed: A way to preview visual content layout before publishing

  This points toward a markdown-based content system with a local preview via dx
   serve. We can discuss the specifics of how content gets processed when we
  reach that decision.

  ---
  Next question:

  Do you have a hosting provider you already use or prefer? (Vercel, Netlify, a
  VPS, self-hosted, etc.) Or are you open to recommendations?

❯ I'm open to suggestions, I don't have any strong preference, I've used    
  Hostinger in the past for very simple projects and I've used AWS for a    
  bit more complicated projects so I already have some experience with      
  both, my two driving factors are cost and ease of use though, if you      
  review our session 1 discussions, you'll see that I don't expect this     
  project to make any significant revenue any time soon, so keeping in mind 
   the limited resources when selecting options especially long term        
  recurring costs is very crucial, but you'll also see that being able to   
  easily release content is also a primary concern, so if we choose a       
  cheaper option it has to be one that even if it might be a bit more       
  complicated to setup initially it won't cause on going friction to use    
  over time, if you are to make a recommendation use the Brave-search and   
  Gemini MCP for research before putting forward any recommendation

● Read 3 files (ctrl+o to expand)

● Good. Based on the research and your requirements, here's my recommendation:

  ---
  Hosting Recommendation

  Your constraints:
  - Minimal/zero recurring cost
  - Low ongoing friction for publishing content
  - Initial setup complexity is acceptable

  Recommended approach: Two-tier strategy

  Tier 1: Static hosting for blog/portfolio (FREE)

  Cloudflare Pages or GitHub Pages

  Both are completely free and handle static sites well. Dioxus SSG (dx bundle 
  --web --ssg) generates static HTML that works with either.
  Factor: Cost
  Cloudflare Pages: Free
  GitHub Pages: Free
  ────────────────────────────────────────
  Factor: Setup
  Cloudflare Pages: Slightly more steps
  GitHub Pages: Simpler (already using GitHub)
  ────────────────────────────────────────
  Factor: CDN
  Cloudflare Pages: Global edge network
  GitHub Pages: GitHub's CDN
  ────────────────────────────────────────
  Factor: Future flexibility
  Cloudflare Pages: Can add Workers for backend later
  GitHub Pages: Static only forever
  My lean: Cloudflare Pages — same ease of use as GitHub Pages, but leaves the
  door open for serverless backend later without migrating.

  Tier 2: Backend for interactive demos (when needed)

  Fly.io — This is what the Dioxus documentation recommends.

  - Free tier includes 3 shared VMs
  - Pay only if you exceed free allowances
  - Docker-based deployment (one-time setup, then fly deploy)
  - Continuous deployment via GitHub Actions

  You wouldn't need this immediately — start with static content, add backend
  when you build demos that require it.

  ---
  Next question:

  Do you have a domain name purchased, or will you need one?

✻ Cogitated for 1m 49s

❯ I haven't purchased a domain name yet, and I plan to purchase one to use  
  with this project, I would like all the content associated with my domain 
   so I want to know how your recommendation of using cloudflare pages will 
   affect that, plus I'll need help selecting an appropriate domain name as 
   well                                                                     

● Good question. Cloudflare Pages actually works very well with custom domains —
   it's one of its strengths.

  How it works:

  1. You buy a domain (from any registrar — Cloudflare, Namecheap, Porkbun,
  etc.)
  2. Point DNS to Cloudflare (or use Cloudflare as your registrar directly)
  3. Connect domain to your Cloudflare Pages project — a few clicks in the
  dashboard
  4. Free SSL certificate is automatically provisioned

  If you buy the domain through Cloudflare Registrar, it's even simpler — no DNS
   configuration needed, just connect it to your Pages project. Cloudflare sells
   domains at cost (no markup), so pricing is competitive.

  All your content lives at yourdomain.com — the default .pages.dev subdomain
  becomes optional/hidden.

  ---
  Now for domain selection:

  What is your intended personal brand or identity for this site? For example:
  - Your real name (e.g., johnsmith.dev)
  - A pseudonym/handle you use online
  - A project/brand name
  - Something else

❯ Although I don't plan to hide my real identity and it would be displayed  
  on the site, my real name is a bit complicated to spell and remember so I 
   don't plan on using it for this site. I would like to optimize the       
  domain name for a few criteria, first something unique to make it stand   
  out more from the noise if people are searching for it, something short   
  and easy to remember, something short and  easy to spell as well, so      
  people can easily find it if recommended by word of mouth, then last but  
  not least if it can be related in some way to learning, development, self 
   improvement through the help of ai, focus, those kind of concepts, since 
   this is a brain storm like activity, spawn three different claude agents 
   and have them use the brave and gemini MCP for verifications but they    
  should each provide you with 5 options for domains they would recommend,  
  I'll be going with .com for everything, once they provide you their       
  recommendations, summarize it and from their options you should provide   
  me with 3 options to choose my preferred choice from

  Agent 2: whetloop, cognihone, honeloop, iterahone, steadycraft

  Agent 3: iteratewell, compoundloop, iterateup, looplearn, compoundself

  ---
  My Top 3 Recommendations

  Evaluating all 15 against your criteria (unique, short, easy to
  spell/remember, thematically relevant):
  Domain: focusloop.com
  Length: 9 chars
  Strengths: Two common words everyone can spell. "Focus" = clarity/intention,
    "loop" = iteration. Unique combination for search. Excellent
    word-of-mouth: "focus loop dot com" is unambiguous.
  ────────────────────────────────────────
  Domain: craftmind.com
  Length: 9 chars
  Strengths: Professional tone. "Craft" = deliberate skill-building, "mind" =
    cognitive/AI themes. Easy to spell, memorable. Evokes intentional
    self-improvement.
  ────────────────────────────────────────
  Domain: growthlog.com
  Length: 9 chars
  Strengths: Most descriptive — immediately signals a learning/development blog.

    "Log" has developer connotations. Clear purpose, very easy to spell
    and recommend verbally.
  ---
  Note: All three appeared available in agent research, but you should verify on
   a registrar (Cloudflare, Namecheap, Porkbun) before deciding.

  Which of these resonates most with you?

✻ Brewed for 5m 2s

❯ Honestly growthlog.com resonated the most but I just checked and the      
  domain is not available, same for focusloop and craftmind, I'm really     
  liking the names that end with log, so let's go for a volume approach     
  this time with the brainstorm, come up with a bunch of names similar to   
  growthlog.com, two syllable easy to say and talk about, easy to spell and 
   remember, let's say spawn 3 agents, 10 ideas each, then I'll check each  
  one and hopefully there should be one out the of the 30 that I both like  
  and is available, if not we keep trying until we find something

❯ ok none of those worked or were available, before we continue lets see if 
   there a way we can improve our speed of iteration and verification,      
  using brave search and gemini, check if there's a way you could verify    
  the availability of the domains yourself, like using some sort of command 
   that calls out to a free api or something for verifying domain           
  availability, that way we can have the sub agents continuously running    
  generating and confirming if any of the ideas they generate are even      
  valid before bringing them up to me

● Good research. The DNS lookup method using dig looks most promising for bulk
  checking - no rate limits and fast. Let me test if it works on your system.

● Bash(which dig && dig NS google.com +short && echo "---" && dig NS
      thisisnotarealdomainxyz123456.com +short)
  ⎿  /usr/bin/dig
     ns3.google.com.
     ns4.google.com.
     … +3 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

● dig works. Registered domains return NS records, unregistered return nothing.
  Let me create a quick check script and test it.

● Bash(check_domain() {
        result=$(dig NS "$1" +short 2>/dev/null)…)
  ⎿  TAKEN: google.com
     AVAILABLE: thisisnotarealdomainxyz123.com
     TAKEN: vorby.com
     TAKEN: striva.com

● The check works. Now I can run agents that generate AND verify availability.
  Let me do a proper batch.

  Shortest/punchiest "my___" picks: mydevrise, mycodepath, mycodeden

  Do any of these resonate, or should we keep searching?

✻ Cogitated for 1m 12s

❯ ok I would honestly want to move past this domain name selection process  
  since I think it's derailed our session more than a little bit, from the  
  all the options provided the ones that resonate and I could confirm are   
  available are mycodepath.com, mylearnbase.com, myskilldeck.com, I need    
  help carefully thinking through all the pros, cons, risks, and            
  opportunities of using any of these domain names, keeping in mind my      
  intended goal for this website as discussed in session 1, and the fact    
  that I may not focus on only code in the future                           

● You're right, let's close this out. Here's a careful analysis based on your
  Session 1 goals.

  ---
  Domain Analysis

  mycodepath.com
  Aspect: Pros
  Analysis: Clear meaning ("my journey in code"). Strong dev identity. Easy to
    remember. Good SEO for coding topics.
  ────────────────────────────────────────
  Aspect: Cons
  Analysis: "Code" locks you into programming content. Feels narrow if you
  expand
     into design, hardware, business, or other learning areas.
  ────────────────────────────────────────
  Aspect: Risk
  Analysis: If you explore non-code topics (which you mentioned is possible),
  the
     domain becomes a poor fit. Rebranding later means losing SEO equity
    and recognition.
  ────────────────────────────────────────
  Aspect: Opportunity
  Analysis: Strong positioning if you stay code-focused. Resonates immediately
    with developer audience.
  mylearnbase.com
  Aspect: Pros
  Analysis: "Learn" is broad — covers any topic. "Base" suggests
    home/foundation/hub. Maximum flexibility for future pivots. Aligns
    with your Session 1 goal of documenting learning across projects (not
     just code).
  ────────────────────────────────────────
  Aspect: Cons
  Analysis: Less punchy. Doesn't immediately signal tech/dev. More generic feel.
  ────────────────────────────────────────
  Aspect: Risk
  Analysis: Generic enough that it might not stand out in a crowded space. Less
    memorable than a more specific name.
  ────────────────────────────────────────
  Aspect: Opportunity
  Analysis: Can grow with you. If you explore AI, hardware, design, business —
    all still fit. Your "learning base" for everything.
  myskilldeck.com
  Aspect: Pros
  Analysis: Unique and memorable. "Deck" metaphor is interesting — collection of

    skills like cards. "Skill" is broad (not code-specific). Modern feel.
     Works well for portfolio (showcasing your "hand").
  ────────────────────────────────────────
  Aspect: Cons
  Analysis: "Deck" is ambiguous — slide deck? playing cards? Might need
    explanation. Less intuitive than the others.
  ────────────────────────────────────────
  Aspect: Risk
  Analysis: Visitors may not immediately understand the metaphor. Could feel
    gimmicky if not leaned into.
  ────────────────────────────────────────
  Aspect: Opportunity
  Analysis: Strong branding potential if you build around the metaphor (skill
    cards, collecting abilities, etc.). Unique angle for portfolio +
    learning.

  Recommendation

  Given your Session 1 context:
  - You want to document learning across projects (not just code)
  - You're preparing for university where interests may diversify
  - You want something that compounds over time

  mylearnbase.com offers the most flexibility. It won't constrain you if your
  interests evolve, and it directly reflects your goal: building a personal base
   for documenting learning.

  mycodepath.com is stronger branding if you're confident you'll stay
  code-focused.

  myskilldeck.com is the most unique but requires commitment to the metaphor.

  ---
  Which direction are you leaning?

✻ Cogitated for 32s

❯ although it's more generic, I like the flexibility that mylearnbase.com   
  offers, plus as I said, I feel we've already spent too long on this so I  
  want to make a decision and move on, I've just bought that domain so lets 
   proceed with the rest of the plan for this session                       

● Good decision. mylearnbase.com is now your domain.

  ---
  Session 2 Progress

  Covered so far:
  - Framework: Dioxus (your preference, we'll work with it)
  - Content authoring: Markdown in editor, local preview for visual content
  - Hosting: Cloudflare Pages (static), Fly.io (backend when needed)
  - Domain: mylearnbase.com

  Still to cover:
  - Content management approach
  - MVP scope
  - Project structure
  - Testing strategy
  - Risk review

  ---
  Next question:

  For your blog content, how do you want markdown files to be organized and
  processed?

  Option A: Flat files in a /posts directory, processed at build time (SSG) —
  simplest approach

  Option B: Structured folders with metadata (e.g.,
  /posts/2024/series-name/part-1.md) — better for series-based content you
  mentioned in Session 1

  Option C: Database-backed with a simple admin interface — more complex, but
  allows editing without code commits

  Which approach fits how you imagine writing and organizing content?

❯ so definitely not option C to start off, I can get behind option B, but   
  it makes me think of the rust concept of re-exporting types so the        
  internal structure of an API can change without external users of the API 
   knowing or caring, I don't want a specific folder structure to get       
  locked in and make it harder for me to make changes to how I organize     
  things in future if my preferences change, that's my I'm leaning most     
  towards option A with the simple flat structure, but as you mentioned I   
  plan to make several posts in a series as I work on a project, so a way   
  to keep track and keep things organized is crucial, so some other way to  
  encode and track metadata is needed, maybe tags, or some other method I   
  can't think of but you can suggest                                        

● That's a smart instinct — decouple organization from file structure. The
  standard solution is frontmatter metadata in each markdown file.

  ---
  Proposed Approach: Flat Files + Frontmatter Metadata

  File structure:
  /content/posts/
    building-my-website-part-1.md
    building-my-website-part-2.md
    rust-cli-tool.md
    random-thought.md

  Each file has YAML frontmatter:
  ---
  title: "Building My Website - Part 1"
  date: 2026-02-01
  tags: ["rust", "dioxus", "web"]
  series: "building-my-website"
  series_order: 1
  draft: false
  ---

  Your markdown content here...

  How it works:
  - Files can be named/renamed freely
  - Series are defined by matching series field, not folders
  - series_order controls sequence within a series
  - Tags provide cross-cutting categorization
  - Build process queries metadata to generate series pages, tag pages, etc.
  - If you later want folders, you can reorganize without breaking links (slugs
  come from frontmatter or filename)

  Benefits:
  - Maximum flexibility — change structure anytime
  - Rich querying — "all posts in series X", "all posts tagged rust"
  - Standard pattern (used by Hugo, Astro, Jekyll, etc.)

  ---
  Does this approach work for you, or do you want to modify the metadata fields?

❯ that makes sense to me, and I don't have any strong opinions on the       
  metadata fields, I plan to be the only author to begin with so tracking   
  that is not relevant, we can discuss this more if needed at the end with  
  the risk review                                                           

● Good. Flat files with frontmatter metadata it is.

  ---
  Next topic: MVP Scope

  From Session 1, your goals were:
  1. Blog/learning journal (series-based posts)
  2. Portfolio (showcase work, host interactive demos)
  3. Monetization (later, organic)

  And your 6-month targets:
  - 10+ articles published
  - 3 demo projects hosted
  - $1/week revenue

  For MVP (4-week target), what's the minimum to get live and start publishing?

  I'd suggest:

  The goal: Get something live so SEO indexing starts, and you can publish your
  first posts.

  Does this MVP scope feel right, or do you want to adjust what's in/out?

❯ that feels fair, something that can get me in the groove of releasing     
  posts as soon as possible and I can use the creation of the rest of the   
  website as content, when filling out the rest of the site in later cycles 

● Exactly — building the website becomes your first series. Meta and practical.

  Next topic: Project Structure

  For a Dioxus fullstack project with your content approach, here's a proposed
  structure:

  mylearnbase/
  ├── src/
  │   ├── main.rs           # Entry point
  │   ├── app.rs            # Root component, router
  │   ├── components/       # Reusable UI components
  │   │   ├── mod.rs
  │   │   ├── header.rs
  │   │   ├── footer.rs
  │   │   └── post_card.rs
  │   └── pages/            # Route components
  │       ├── mod.rs
  │       ├── home.rs
  │       ├── blog.rs

  ├── content/
  │   └── posts/            # Markdown files with frontmatter
  ├── assets/
  │   ├── styles/           # CSS/SCSS
  │   └── images/
  ├── Cargo.toml
  ├── Dioxus.toml
  └── README.md

  Key decisions embedded here:
  - components/ vs pages/ separation (common pattern)
  - content/ outside src/ (content isn't code)
  - assets/ for static files

  Does this structure make sense, or would you organize it differently?

❯ I don't have any strong opinions, are there any variations or different   
  structures that could be more beneficial, what are the pros, cons, risks, 
   and opportunities related to different structures, are there specific    
  structures that work best with Dioxus?                                    

● Let me check the Dioxus documentation for recommended patterns.

● Read 2 files (ctrl+o to expand)

● Based on the Dioxus documentation, here are the structure options with
  trade-offs:

  ---
  Structure Options

  Option A: Minimal (Dioxus "bare-bones" template)

  ├── src/
  │   └── main.rs        # Everything starts here, split files as needed
  ├── assets/
  ├── content/posts/
  ├── Cargo.toml
  └── Dioxus.toml

  │                 Pros                  │                Cons                │
  ├───────────────────────────────────────┼────────────────────────────────────┤
  │ No premature structure                │ Will need refactoring as app grows │
  ├───────────────────────────────────────┼────────────────────────────────────┤
  │ Organize naturally as patterns emerge │ Less guidance upfront              │
  ├───────────────────────────────────────┼────────────────────────────────────┤
  │ Matches Dioxus tutorial approach      │                                    │
  └───────────────────────────────────────┴────────────────────────────────────┘
  Option B: Component-organized (common convention)

  ├── src/
  │   ├── main.rs
  │   ├── components/    # Reusable UI pieces
  │   └── pages/         # Route-level components
  ├── assets/
  ├── content/posts/
  Pros: Clear separation by type
  Cons: May feel arbitrary at small scale
  ────────────────────────────────────────
  Pros: Common pattern (transferable knowledge)
  Cons: Components vs pages line can blur
  ────────────────────────────────────────
  Pros: Easier onboarding if others contribute
  Cons:
  Option C: Feature-based

  ├── src/
  │   ├── main.rs
  │   ├── blog/          # All blog-related code
  │   ├── home/          # Homepage code

  ├───────────────────────────────────────┼───────────────────────────────┤
  │ Related code together                 │ Shared components awkward     │

  │ Easy to find everything for a feature │ Less common in Rust ecosystem │
  └───────────────────────────────────────┴───────────────────────────────┘

  Recommendation

  Start with Option A (minimal), then let structure emerge. For MVP you'll have
  maybe 3-5 components — not enough to justify directories. Add components/ and
  pages/ folders when you feel the need, not before.

  This matches your earlier instinct about flexibility (like with content
  organization).

  Does that approach work for you?

❯ yes, let's start minimal, but make a note somewhere that we should be     
  reviewing the need for code refactoring and restructure as we progress in 
   future cycles                                                            

● Noted. I'll include that as a standing review item in the architecture
  document.

  Next topic: Testing Strategy

  For a personal blog/portfolio MVP, testing needs are minimal but worth
  defining upfront.

  Options:
  Approach: Manual only
  What it covers: Click through before deploy
  Effort: Zero setup
  ────────────────────────────────────────
  Approach: Build-time checks
  What it covers: Rust compiler catches type errors, dx build verifies it
    compiles
  Effort: Already built-in
  ────────────────────────────────────────
  Approach: Content validation
  What it covers: Script to check frontmatter is valid, no broken internal links
  Effort: Low effort, high value
  ────────────────────────────────────────
  Approach: E2E tests (Playwright)
  What it covers: Automated browser tests for critical paths
  Effort: Higher effort, overkill for MVP
  Recommendation for MVP:
  - Rely on Rust compiler + manual testing
  - Add a simple content validation script (check frontmatter fields exist,
  dates are valid)
  - Defer E2E tests until the site has stable features worth protecting

  Does this feel right, or do you want more/less testing infrastructure from the
   start?

❯ follow your recommendation, lets defer the E2E tests for now, but         
  implement the other easier tests                                          

● Got it. Testing strategy:
  - Rust compiler + dx build for type safety
  - Manual testing before deploys
  - Content validation script (frontmatter checks)
  - E2E tests deferred

  Final topic: Risk Review

  Per the process, we end Session 2 by identifying structural risks that could
  cause problems during implementation.

  Potential risks I see:
  Risk: Dioxus SSG maturity
  Likelihood: Medium
  Impact: High
  Mitigation: Test SSG workflow early in Cycle 1. If it doesn't work smoothly,
    fallback to client-side rendering or consider alternative.
  ────────────────────────────────────────
  Risk: Markdown processing in Dioxus
  Likelihood: Medium
  Impact: High
  Mitigation: Dioxus doesn't have built-in markdown support. Will need a crate
    (e.g., pulldown-cmark) and build-time processing. Validate this
    works before building full blog.
  ────────────────────────────────────────
  Risk: Cloudflare Pages + Dioxus compatibility
  Likelihood: Low
  Impact: Medium
  Mitigation: Dioxus SSG outputs static files which Cloudflare handles fine.
  Test
     deploy early.
  ────────────────────────────────────────
  Risk: Content workflow friction
  Likelihood: Low
  Impact: Medium
  Mitigation: Writing → preview → deploy loop might be clunky. Monitor during
    first posts, adjust if needed.
  ────────────────────────────────────────
  Risk: Scope creep
  Likelihood: Medium
  Impact: Medium
  Mitigation: MVP is intentionally small. Stick to it.
  ---
  Recommended proof-of-concept (start of Cycle 1):

  Before building the full site, validate the riskiest assumption:
  1. Create minimal Dioxus project
  2. Load and render one markdown file with frontmatter
  3. Build with dx bundle --web --ssg
  4. Deploy to Cloudflare Pages

  If this works, proceed confidently. If not, we'll know early.

  ---
  Any other risks you're thinking about, or questions on these?

❯ none for now, but if Dioxus does not natively support markdown does their 
   documentation recommend a specific way to handle it, are there better    
  ways described online, check with brave search and gemini to confirm as   
  part of our risk mitigation strategy, otherwise I agree with the rest of  
  the risks and the proof of concept needed

● Good findings. Here's the confirmed approach for markdown in Dioxus:

  ---
  Markdown in Dioxus - Confirmed Approach

  Dioxus does NOT have built-in markdown support, but there are two
  well-documented approaches:

  Option 1: dioxus-markdown crate (community solution)

  use dioxus_markdown::Markdown;

  rsx! {
      Markdown { content: markdown_string }
  }
  - Simple component-based approach
  - Actively maintained

  Option 2: Pre-render to HTML + dangerous_inner_html (official docs approach)

  // Convert markdown to HTML using pulldown-cmark or comrak
  let html = markdown_to_html(&content);

  rsx! {
      div { dangerous_inner_html: "{html}" }
  }
  - Used by the official Dioxus homepage
  - Smaller bundle size
  - More control over rendering

  Frontmatter Parsing

  Use gray-matter crate to separate YAML frontmatter from content:
  use gray_matter::{Matter, engine::YAML};

  let matter = Matter::<YAML>::new();
  let result = matter.parse(file_content);
  let frontmatter: Frontmatter = result.data.deserialize().unwrap();
  let content = result.content;

  ---
  Updated risk mitigation:

  The path is clear — this is a solved problem with documented solutions. The
  proof-of-concept should validate:
  1. gray-matter parses frontmatter correctly
  2. Either dioxus-markdown or dangerous_inner_html renders content properly
  3. SSG build works with this setup

  This reduces the markdown processing risk from Medium to Low.

  Updated Risk Review
  Risk: Dioxus SSG maturity
  Likelihood: Low→Medium
  Impact: Medium
  Status: Reduced
  Mitigation: 0.7 release is stable, 1.0 expected mid-2026. Community reports it

    works. Build in release mode. Join Discord for support if issues
    arise.
  ────────────────────────────────────────
  Risk: Markdown processing
  Likelihood: Low
  Impact: Low
  Status: ✅ Resolved
  Mitigation: Clear path: gray-matter + dioxus-markdown or dangerous_inner_html.

    Documented approach.
  ────────────────────────────────────────
  Risk: Cloudflare Pages compatibility
  Likelihood: Low
  Impact: Low
  Status: ✅ Resolved
  Mitigation: Confirmed working. Need custom build command (install Rust, wasm
    target, dx CLI, then build). Set correct output directory.
  ────────────────────────────────────────
  Risk: Content workflow friction
  Likelihood: Low
  Impact: Medium
  Status: Unchanged
  Mitigation: Monitor during first posts. dx serve hot reload is good but has
    edge cases.
  ────────────────────────────────────────
  Risk: Scope creep
  Likelihood: Medium
  Impact: Medium
  Status: Unchanged
  Mitigation: Stick to MVP scope.

  Cloudflare Pages Deploy Config (for reference)

  Build command will need:
  curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh -s -- -y
  source ~/.cargo/env
  rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
  cargo install dioxus-cli
  dx build --release --ssg

  Output directory: dist (or as configured in Dioxus.toml)

  Summary: All major technical risks now have clear mitigation paths. The
  proof-of-concept at cycle start will validate everything works together, but
  the research suggests no blockers.

  Next Session: Session 3 - Planning (Cycle 1)

  We'll break the MVP into actionable tasks and create tasks.md.

  When you're ready to start, just say "session 3" and I'll pick up from here.

✻ Cooked for 1m 9s

❯ I just realized something else we should add to the frontmatter, the      
  slug, I want to be able to change the file name, and the title in the     
  frontmatter without being afraid that I'll break links, so update the     
  architecture section describing the front matter to include a required    
  slug field                                                                

● Good catch. That's important for stable URLs.

● Update(architecture.md)
  ⎿  Added 2 lines
      39  ```yaml
      40  ---
      41  title: "Post Title"
      42 +slug: "post-title"           # REQUIRED - determines URL, never
         + change once published                                         
      43  date: 2026-02-01
      44  tags: ["rust", "dioxus", "web"]
      45  series: "series-name"        # optional
     ...
      49  ```
      50  
      51  **Why this approach:**
      52 +- `slug` decouples URL from filename and title — rename files o
         +r update titles without breaking links                         
      53  - Files can be renamed/reorganized without breaking relationshi
          ps
      54  - Series defined by metadata, not folders
      55  - Maximum flexibility for future changes

● Done. Added slug as a required field with the note that it determines the URL
  and should never change once published. This decouples the URL from both
  filename and title.

❯ I guess before we continue, I haven't initialized this project as a git   
  repository yet, so let's do so then I can follow your instructions to     
  make the first commit                                                     

● Bash(git init)

● Repository initialized on main branch. Before committing, let me check what's
  in a couple of these directories to recommend what should/shouldn't be
  tracked.

● Bash(ls -la /home/me/projects/website/mcp-servers/ && echo "---" && du -sh
      /home/me/projects/website/resources/)

     … +3 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

● Some files might not belong in the website repo. Here's my recommendation:
  File/Directory: CLAUDE.md
  Recommendation: Include
  Reason: Project instructions
  ────────────────────────────────────────
  File/Directory: PROJECT_PROCESS.md
  Recommendation: Include
  Reason: Process documentation
  ────────────────────────────────────────
  File/Directory: project.md
  Recommendation: Include
  Reason: Project tracker
  ────────────────────────────────────────
  File/Directory: architecture.md
  Recommendation: Include
  Reason: Architecture decisions
  ────────────────────────────────────────
  File/Directory: project_template.md
  Recommendation: Include or remove
  Reason: Template - useful for reference
  ────────────────────────────────────────
  File/Directory: .log/
  Recommendation: Include
  Reason: Session exports (per your process)
  ────────────────────────────────────────
  File/Directory: resources/
  Recommendation: Exclude
  Reason: Reference docs, not part of website
  ────────────────────────────────────────
  File/Directory: mcp-servers/
  Recommendation: Exclude
  Reason: Local MCP config, not part of website
  ────────────────────────────────────────
  File/Directory: .mcp.json
  Recommendation: Exclude
  Reason: Local MCP config
  Want me to create a .gitignore with these exclusions and then stage the
  appropriate files?

❯ I agree with all your recommendations, create the gitignore and stage the 
   appropriate files
